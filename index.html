We salute his yearning for quest conquest in the odyssey of life well integrated with values, character and academic excellence as the vehicle of transformation of soul more than transaction of materialistic pursuits. The whole TMIS family is united to value his valour of dreams as a mark of collective solidarity for uplifting life with wings of change.</h3>

            <p id="p2"class="p1">TM International School is an eminent educational institution established under magnificent aegis of Gyan Mangal Education and Charitable Sanstha, Bharatpur. It aims at helping the children from far flung rural areas to have an easy access to Modern Education System and Explore, Evoke their personality traits so as to overcome the problems of life such as indiscipline, impertinence, frustration and any perverted habit through regular toiling and endeavour by being noble, contained and civilized citizen of our great INDIA. Taking a clue from intuition spurred by a ‘Galaxy of Educationist’ it will be our endeavour to cultivate sensibility, sensitivity and creativity of the students in addition to their intellectual development.

TMIS is situated in a perfect Indian setting yet delivers an International Education. The building is modern and spacious and offers the students the nearest comfort of home within the city at Rajasthan’s Eastern Gate, The Brij Bhoomi also known as the ‘Lohagarh’, i.e. Bharatpur.

The education system besides providing an all round education intellectually, socially, emotionally and physically, also offers guidance in critical thinking, social openness and in purposeful research. Students are given the opportunities to develop their own talents and the same time to be aware of National and Global issues, while contributing to the healthy development of the needs of their own school campus and community.

Homework is given to encourage and develop independent study skills and to complement the particular fields of study. A homework time-table is issued to all students who are required to complete the work as assigned by the subject-teachers.

On entry into the school, each pupil is placed in a fixed form group of not more than 40 (forty) under guidance of form-tutor who will be responsible for monitoring all aspects of progress and welfare. The form tutor is the first point of contact for parents on any issue concerning the child. The school will actively encourage strong links with parents to ensure that at all times they are kept fully informed on any concerns they or the school may have.</p>
